# flood_detection
This project aims to detect humans and animals in both flood-affected and unaffected areas using images. It employs a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to efficiently identify and classify objects. The objective is to assist in disaster management by providing an automated method for identifying living beings in challenging environments.
